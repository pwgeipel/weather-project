# Peter Geipel's Weather Dashboard

## Description

Upon opening the dashboard page, the user will be prompted to enter the name of a city in the search field.  Using the OpenWeatherMap API, this dashboard will then provide the user with not only the current weather conditions for that city (including temperature, humidity, and wind), but also the 5-day forecast.

Additionally, after the search, the name of the city will be saved into local storage.  A button with the city's name will appear (generated from local storage), allowing the user to quickly research one of their recent city searches.
